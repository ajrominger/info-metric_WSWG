Open questions in info-metrics and its applications across fields

## Group 1
  
  - How change is measured, how rates of change are measured, what is time?
  - Time from physics should be universally useful to other fields, but there could be other notions of time (e.g. number of events that have occurred) in specific fields that could be more useful there
  - Time could be information-based: time "dilation" depending on how much is going on
  - Picking the right time simplifies solutions
  - Different notions of time could provide different insights
  - reference states: from what to what; this could be discipline independent
  - how do you pick relevant variables beyond years of trial and error?

## Group 2

  - If you adopt info-metrics as rational inference, how do you know it's going to work? i.e. having good out of sample fit
    - If you don't get good fit, Jaynes says you need more or different constraints
  - High dimensional cases are hard to fit with info-metrics, you could reduce the dimension of the data with PCA

## Group 3

  - Computational issues
    - How do we make info entropy as a prior computationally efficient
    - Why is it that statisticians don't care about MaxEnt?
    - How do we deal with data reduction or compression to get metrics that are useful
    - How do we marry graph theory to queuing theory (as used in Bell Labs)?
  - Broadening info-metrics
    - How do broaden the reach of maxent methods so that we can share methods across fields? How do you get people to understand maxent methods? and implement?
    - How do we frame questions in an amenable way for analysis
    - How do we make info-metric methods meaningful outside of physics
    - How do we identify experiments in order to maximize information acquisition? (identify constraints for models)

## Group 4

  - What is the minimal information I need in order to connect subsystems?
  - How do I infer with MaxEnt the links between sub-systems that are themselves well described by MaxEnt?


## Group at large

  - If we had a new definition of complexity, what would we gain?
  - Can we use complexity to decide how parameter-rich our models should be?
  - Can non-parametric Bayes be a way to make model selection self-consistent with penalization of over-parameterization?
